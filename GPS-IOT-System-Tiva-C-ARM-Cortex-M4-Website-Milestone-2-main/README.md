# GPS Embedded Systems Project - Milestone 2

This project is not just an embedded systems project. It’s an IOT device (Internet Of Things). A GPS tracker system that measures the distance moved very accurately and can give an indication when reaching the destination point. Not only that, but it also send the data fetched from the GPS module to a live web server through esp8266 Wi-Fi module and POST requests and can be tracked through a website that communicate with the same server from anywhere on the Earth in real time.

## Technologies used in the website

- Front end  => HTML, Css, Js, Bootstrap, Ajax
- Back end   => nodejs, express

## Features
- Calculating the distance between any two points on Earth using haversine formula 
- displaying the distance on the 7-segment dynamically without needing to call any functions due to using interrupts
- Delay function using Systick timer which is very accurate 
- Distance can be calculated in non-straight line paths with a very high accuracy
- Sends the calculated distance and also the received data (including Latitude, Longitude, Real time, Date, Speed in m/s) to a live webserver that can be accessed from a website anywhere on the Earth. 
- Wi-Fi communications are done using Uart interrupt which run in the background in order not to delay the main code and functionality (Reading GPS data).
- Wi-Fi communications can handle the case if any error happened during connection (like if the server took too long to respond or the connection is poor) by trying again and again. 
- Distance can be calculated on the 7-segment display for up to 9999m (10km) and beyond that distance can still be calculated and sent to the website and the 7-segment will show 1 on the rightmost segment indicating overflow.
